After you filled out the metadata form you can now validate your metadata by pressing the ``Validate Metadata`` button on the right side. If all metadata is set in a right way, you should be able to save the metadata. Your repository is now set up for further steps. 


Data editing
============
Now that you got your RADAR-ID or DOI (weather its archiving or publishing) for your dataset, you have a maximum of 6 months for editing the data. You can now add files or make some changes. After the 6 months passed you won't be able to edit the dataset anymore. 

Review status
=============
You can also go ahead and put your dataset into a reviewing status. While the status of your repository is ``reviewing`` you can't edit anything until the reviewing has ended. RADAR generates a link to your repository which you can send to a reviewer. The dataset can be downloaded only by using this link. 

Archiving/publishing
====================
Depending on your choice on the persistent identifier (RADAR-ID or DOI) you should choose weather you want to archive (RADAR-ID) or publish (DOI) it. For both purposes the metadata will be checked for completeness. Depending on what action you've chosen, the status of your dataset will switch from ``pending`` to ``archived`` or ``published``.

For published dataset you can also set an embargo-time of up to one year. The dataset will only be accessible to others after the embargo-time has expired whereas the metadata is already publicly available with a hint to the embargo-time. 

For the archived datasets, curators can also define access rights by adding users with access rights to the dataset. Those users can be defined by usernames or e-mail addresses in a free text field.
