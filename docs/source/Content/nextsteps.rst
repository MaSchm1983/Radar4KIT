After you filled out the metadata form you can now validate your metadata by pressing the "Validate Metadata" button on the right side. If all metadata is set in a right way, you should be able to save the metadata. Congratulation, you're repository is set up for further action now. 


Data editing
============
Now that you got your RADAR-ID or DOI (weather its archiving or publishing) for your dataset, you have at maximum 6 month for editing the data. You can now add files or make some changes. Ater the 6 month you won't be able to edit the dataset anymore. 

Review status
=============
You can also go ahead an put your dataset into reviewing status. While the status of your repository is "reviewing" you can't edit anything until the reviewing has ended. RADAR generates a link to you're repository which you can send to a reviewer. The dataset can be downloaded only by using this link. 

Archiving/publishing
====================
Depending on your choise on the persistent identifier (RADAR-ID or DOI) you should chose weather you want to archive (RADAR-ID) or publish (DOI) it. For both purposes the metadata will be checked for completeness. Depending on what action you chose, the status of your dataset will switch from "pending" to "archived" or "published".

For published dataset you can also set an embargo-time up to one year. The dataset will only be accessible to others after the embargo-time has expired whereas the metadata is already publicly available with a hint to the embargo-time. 

For the archived datasets, curators can also define access rights by adding users with access rights to the dataset. Those users, they can be defined by user names or e-mail addresses ina free text field.
