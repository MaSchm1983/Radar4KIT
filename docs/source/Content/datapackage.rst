Create a data package
+++++++++++++++++++++

So, how do you create a data package once you get your authorization as subcurator? Since you're authorized as subcurator you can find the button "create dataset" on the left side of the window. Click that button for the next step.

You can chose between two options, 

#. Upload dataset (Figure 2.1) or 
#. Create empty dataset (Figure 2.2).

An empty dataset might be useful if you wanna reserve a DOI for a later time, but usually you'll use option 1 if you already have you're dataset available. In this case you can select your file (e.g. a single file or an archive like .zip, .tar, .tgz, .tar.gz., .tar.bz2) or drag-n-drop the file to the upload field. 

.. NOTE:: Data formats
    Your data should be formatted in a proper way. Note that everyone who will use your data in future needs as many information as you can give for reusing the data. Therefore you should define your data with proper metadata following well-known conventions (e.g. cf convenctions etc.), a common file format (e.g. .nc, .h5, .csv), a proper naming (e.g. ``<modelname/campaign>_<device/sensor/version>_<variable>_<date/timerange>.<datatyp>``) and some standards following the `FAIR Data Principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_. The more information you can share the more is the increases of value of your data set!
